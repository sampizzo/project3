Super Syntax Tutor is an app that allows you to train your typing skills on basic computer language syntax. 

## Getting Started
Create an account, or use our demo account!
Username: demo123
Password: demo123


After login you can select a language from the dashboard and click the "lets'play" button.

Type the sintax falling from top to bottom. 
If the lives get to 0 the game is over, the user have the option of replay that game or select new game from the menu page.

## Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

npm install
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

npm start
Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## About
This app uses React to handle the view and functionality, Express and Node for server-side API routing, and MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage. Passport.js authenticates user login credentials. This application follows the MVC design pattern.

Technologies used: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node, Passport.js, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS3, and HTML5.
